# Predicting User Ad Interactions with TensorFlow  

This project focuses on **predicting user interactions with online advertisements** using machine learning models built in **TensorFlow/Keras**.  

The notebook explores how preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation metrics affect the performance of predictive models for three user behaviors:  
- **label_view** – whether the user views an ad  
- **label_click** – whether the user clicks on an ad  
- **label_landing** – whether the user lands on the advertiser’s site or completes a purchase  

Accurate prediction of these events is crucial for improving **ad placement**, **user experience**, and **advertising revenue optimization**.  
This work was carried out during the **Data Science Summer School at Teads**, where participants explored applied machine learning techniques for online advertising and user engagement.
